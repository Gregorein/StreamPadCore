use Plop.js to generate boilerplate code from something similar to my Component.ts definition

1. 
ok, now lets try to bundle this single component, use rollup

2. 
okay - and how to use this packaged component? Remember - it'll not be used in code, but in a running app

-1.
Okay - I prepared step-by-step plan:
```
Phase 1: Design the Package Structure
Define Package Contents:

Identify the files and directories that will be included in the distributable package.
Compiled Components: The JavaScript/CSS files for the UI controls.
Metadata File: controls-manifest.json that lists components, version, dependencies, etc.
Component Testing: Add unit and integration tests for each component and utility function to ensure stability as new features are added.
Create a Template Package:

Draft an example package structure, including a basic UI control, to serve as a reference.
Define controls-manifest.json Schema:

Design the JSON schema that will describe the components.
Include fields like name, version, dependencies, entry-point, and any configuration options.
Develop Packaging Script:

Write a script to automate the creation of the distributable package from the source code.
Ensure the script compiles the components, organizes them into the correct directory structure, and generates the controls-manifest.json.
Phase 2: Develop the Update Mechanism
Implement Update Check in StreamPad App:

Modify the StreamPad App to check for updates on startup.
This involves fetching the latest release info from the StreamPadCore GitHub repository (via the GitHub API or direct download link).
Download and Extract the Package:

Implement logic to download the latest package (if available) and extract it to the /components directory.
Ensure the old package is safely backed up or replaced.
Security Considerations: Ensure that the update mechanism verifies the integrity of downloaded packages (e.g., through checksums or signatures) to prevent malicious tampering.
Error Handling and Rollbacks: Implement rollback mechanisms or recovery options in case updates fail to maintain stability.
Handle Versioning and Compatibility:

Implement version checks to ensure compatibility between the StreamPad App and the Core components.
Include mechanisms to handle incompatible or deprecated components gracefully.
Versioning Strategy: Define a clear versioning strategy (e.g., Semantic Versioning) to manage compatibility effectively.
Phase 3: StreamPad App Integration
Dynamic Component Loading:

Modify the StreamPad App to dynamically load components based on the controls-manifest.json.
Ensure the app can render these components as React elements within the UI.
Define the Component Interface:

Create a standard interface that each control must implement.
This interface should handle initialization, event handling, and state management.
Provide a base React component or class that custom controls can extend.
Interaction with Plugins:

Implement methods within the component interface to allow communication with StreamPad App plugins.
This may include event handling, data passing, or direct API interactions.
Phase 4: Support for Custom Controls
Document the Custom Control Development Process:

Create documentation that outlines how users can develop their custom UI controls.
Include a guide on packaging, distributing, and integrating these controls with StreamPad.
Create Example Custom Controls:

Develop a few example controls to serve as templates for custom control developers.
Distribute these examples within the documentation or as part of a separate "developer resources" package.
Test Custom Control Integration:

Rigorously test the integration of custom controls in the StreamPad App.
Ensure that custom controls interact correctly with both the UI Editor and available plugins.
Phase 5: Finalize and Deploy
Set Up Continuous Integration (CI) for Releases:

Implement a CI pipeline to automate the process of compiling and releasing the StreamPadCore package.
Ensure that each release is properly versioned and includes all necessary files.
Automated Testing in CI: Include automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) as part of the CI pipeline to catch issues early.
Automated Documentation: Automate the generation of documentation within the CI pipeline to ensure itâ€™s always up to date.
Community Engagement:

Launch the documentation and templates to the community.
Encourage feedback and contributions to refine the core components and custom control interface.
Monitor and Iterate:

After the initial deployment, monitor the feedback and issues.
Iterate on the design and implementation as needed, particularly focusing on ease of use and compatibility.
