# StreamPadCore Component Library

Welcome to the StreamPadCore component library! This library provides a set of reusable UI components and utilities designed to ensure consistency and efficiency across all StreamPad projects.

## Components

The components focus on user-configurable interfaces for stream control. These are interactive and often represent custom controls that streamers can use, such as:
- Buttons, Knobs, Sliders
- Toggles and Indicators
- Layout components like Grids and Panels

## Using the Library
This Storybook serves as a live documentation tool, showcasing the components and their various states. You can interact with and explore the components here to understand their functionalities and customization options.

Explore the sidebar to start viewing the components and their usage examples!

## Roadmap

This component library is part of the larger StreamPad project. We are currently working through several phases of development, including packaging and distribution of these components for easy integration with the StreamPad desktop application and companion app. Future updates will enhance customizability and ease of use for developers creating their own controls.
